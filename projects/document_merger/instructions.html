        Welcome, you have come to find out more about this little google Docs
        add-on I wrote in the summer of 2023. This was a passion project for my
        partner at the time who was working on a manuscript for her first
        collection of short stories. The idea was that she wanted to edit the
        stories in their own documents, but then have a thing that could merge
        them all together. So if that's similar to what you want to do, then
        let's get started.
      </p>
      <div>------------------------------------------------</div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Create a google drive folder that you can put all the Doc files into
            that you want to be merged into one. Create a new blank google Doc
            inside this same folder.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img
            src="C:\Users\kccla\Documents\GitHub\kcrowder.gihub.io\content\document_merger_example_1_start.png"
            class="card-img-top"
            alt="Google Doc, blank page, document title
    is 'Document Merger Example'. The Document Merger right Side panel
    is shown. It reads 'This Add-on is designed to copy multiple Docs
    within this Document's Drive folder into this current one. 1. Make
    sure that this folder contains all and only the documents you want
    merge. This one will be ignored. 2. Please set the order of the
    documents by putting '#1' in the name of the document like '#1 The
    Big Red Dog'. In this example, the heading for the section of text
    contained in the document named '#1 The Big Red Dog' will be 'The
    Big Red Dog' ignoring the number, spaces, and any text before it.
    3. When the documents are in order and the names of the document
    as you want the headings to be, click 'Get Started' "
          />
          <p>
            Open that blank Doc and give it a name. This will be the container
            file for all the other documents you have included in the folder.
            Make sure you have the add-on downloaded from the google add-on
            store. Extensions > Add-ons > Get Add-ons > Search: "Document
            Merger". Accept terms. After, click the little blue-green circle
            button that says "dM" on the add-on bar floating on the right hand
            side. This will pull up the right side panel seen here.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img
            src="C:\Users\kccla\Documents\GitHub\kcrowder.gihub.io\content\document_merger_example_2_drive__folder.png"
            class="card-img-top"
            alt="Google drive folder name 'Manuscripts' is shown with 5 google Doc files inside. In order first to last 'Document Merger Example','Copy of Chapter #44 The Other Tree', 'Chaper #2. The Tree', '#1 Forward', and last '#3 The Cloud'. "
          />
          <p>
            With your document named, go back to your drive folder you created
            this in and let's talk about naming conventions for a minute. You
            can see here that I have the drive folder open named "Manuscripts".
            Inside of this folder is the blank file we just created and then 4
            other files, these I will refer to as source files, all of which
            have a "#_" and a word or phrase as their document name.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img
            src="C:\Users\kccla\Documents\GitHub\kcrowder.gihub.io\content\document_merger_example_3_search_folder.png"
            class="card-img-top"
            alt="Google Doc, blank page, document title
      is 'Document Merger Example'. The Document Merger right Side panel
      is shown. It reads 'Click to open folder in new tab, Manuscripts' and 'SEARCH Manuscripts Folder' "
          />
          <p>
            Now lets click that get started button and see what we find. Because
            the document you just created is within that folder "Manuscripts",
            you will see that folder name show up here as clickable link back to
            the folder, and also a "SEARCH" button.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img
            src="C:\Users\kccla\Documents\GitHub\kcrowder.gihub.io\content\document_merger_example_4_files.png"
            class="card-img-top"
            alt="Google Doc, blank page, document title
      is 'Document Merger Example'. The Document Merger right Side panel
      is shown. It reads 'Available Documents to Merge
      click item to open in new tab

      2. The Tree

      44. The Other Tree

      Preserve Original Formatting?' "
          />
          <p>
            After clicking the search button, it will think for a bit, then
            return the ordered list of items you have put into your folder. Keep
            in mind that this will ignore any file that is not a google Doc;
            spreadsheets, .txt will not be read or included.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img
            src="C:\Users\kccla\Documents\GitHub\kcrowder.gihub.io\content\document_merger_example_5_naming.png"
            class="card-img-top"
            alt="A mash up of the drive folder names and the document list generated in the previous image is shown side by side with weird little red arrows connecting the filename to the name and order they will have in the collection document."
          />
          <p>
            Now you can see how the naming played a role in the order of the
            documents. The condition I have set up for this is to always come
            before a number with the pound(#) symbol. Any number after that will
            be interpreted as an ordering element. Any text before the pound
            will be ignored, and subsequently any text after the pound symbol
            will be the title of the chapter or section. If you need to include
            a pound symbol as the name of the document, do so after you have
            included the numbering element, ie: 'Chapter #1 #gaylor'.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img
            src="C:\Users\kccla\Documents\GitHub\kcrowder.gihub.io\content\document_merger_example_options.png"
            class="card-img-top"
            alt="Two toggle options are shown, 'Add Page Breaks Between Documents' and 'Preserve Original Formatting' The latter of the two is on by default which is show with a blue slider check."
          />
          <p>
            Before clicking 'Merge', let me explain the two options that are
            provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Add Page Breaks Between Documents' when toggled on, blue with a
            check, will add a page break character between each of the documents
            in the merge. This will mean that each section that is created from
            a source document will start on a new page.
          </p>
          <p>
            'Preserve Original Formatting?' when toggled on, blue with a check,
            will do its best to maintain any formatting that has been applied to
            the text in the source document and transfer that into the container
            document, and only for that section. This works pretty consistently
            for font selection and colors and line spacing.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <img
            src="C:\Users\kccla\Documents\GitHub\kcrowder.gihub.io\content\document_merger_example_6_complete.png"
            class="card-img-top"
            alt="Image shows google doc with text in it. The sidebar has returned to its homepage, the summary feature on the left handside shows the list of all documents that have been included."
          />
          <p>
            After you have clicked Merge, you will see all of your text within
            the container document. To get the Outline to show on the left,
            navigate to View > Show Outline in the utility bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you make edits to the source documents, you will have to run
            these steps again. A change to the source Doc doesn't create a
            parallel change in the collection document. When you rerun the
            merge, it will try to delete the items that have matching titles
            such to not create duplicates but a thorough check should be done to
            make sure that worked properly.

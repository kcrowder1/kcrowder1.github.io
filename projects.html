            Welcome, you have come to find out more about this little google
            Docs add on I wrote in the summer of 2023. This was a passion
            project for my partner at the time who was working on a manuscript
            for her first collection of short stories. The idea was that she
            wanted to edit the stories on their own, but then have a thing that
            could merge them all together. So if that's similar to what you want
            to do, then let's get started.
          </p>
          <div>------------------------------------------------</div>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Create a google drive folder that you can put all the Doc files
                into that you want to be merged into one. Create a new blank
                google Doc inside this same folder.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <img
                src="content/document_merger_example_1_start.png "
                class="card-img-top"
                alt="Google Doc, blank page, document title
          is 'Document Merger Example'. The Document Merger right Side panel
          is shown. It reads 'This Add-on is designed to copy multiple Docs
          within this Document's Drive folder into this current one. 1. Make
          sure that this folder contains all and only the documents you want
          merge. This one will be ignored. 2. Please set the order of the
          documents by putting '#1' in the name of the document like '#1 The
          Big Red Dog'. In this example, the heading for the section of text
          contained in the document named '#1 The Big Red Dog' will be 'The
          Big Red Dog' ignoring the number, spaces, and any text before it.
          3. When the documents are in order and the names of the document
          as you want the headings to be, click 'Get Started' "
              />
              <p>
                Open that blank Doc and give it a name. This will be the
                container for all the other documents you have included in the
                folder. After naming it, click the little blue-green circle
                button that says "dM". This will pull up the right side panel
                seen here.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <img
                src="content/document_merger_example_2_drive__folder.png "
                class="card-img-top"
                alt="Google drive folder name 'Manuscripts' is shown with 5 google Doc files inside. In order first to last 'Document Merger Example','Copy of Chaper #44 The Other Tree', 'Chaper #2. The Tree', '#1 Forward', and last '#3 The Cloud'. "
              />
              <p>
                With your document named, go back to your drive folder you
                created this in and let's talk about naming conventions for a
                minute. You can see here that I have the drive folder open named
                "Manuscripts". Inside of this folder is the blank file we just
                created and then 4 other files, these I will refer to as source
                files, all of which have a "#_" and a word or phrase.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <img
                src="content/document_merger_example_3_search_folder.png "
                class="card-img-top"
                alt="Google Doc, blank page, document title
            is 'Document Merger Example'. The Document Merger right Side panel
            is shown. It reads 'Click to open folder in new tab, Manuscripts' and 'SEARCH Manuscripts Folder' "
              />
              <p>
                Now lets click that get started button and see what we find.
                Because the document you just created is within that folder
                "Manuscripts", you will see that folder name show up here as
                clickable link back to the folder, and also a "SEARCH" button.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <img
                src="content/document_merger_example_4_files.png "
                class="card-img-top"
                alt="Google Doc, blank page, document title
            is 'Document Merger Example'. The Document Merger right Side panel
            is shown. It reads 'Available Documents to Merge
            click item to open in new tab
            LAST DOCUMENT CHANGE: 6/20/2023 6:58:09 PM
            1. Forward
            LAST DOCUMENT CHANGE: 6/24/2023 11:39:42 PM
            2. The Tree
            LAST DOCUMENT CHANGE: 6/20/2023 6:01:43 PM
            3. The Cloud
            LAST DOCUMENT CHANGE: 6/26/2023 3:34:56 PM
            44. The Other Tree
            Add Page Breaks Between Documents?
            Perserve Original Formatting?' "
              />
              <p>
                After clicking the search button, it will think for a bit, then
                return the ordered list of items you have put into your folder.
                Keep in mind that this will ignore any file that is not a google
                Doc; spreadsheets, .txt will not be read or included.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <img
                src="content/document_merger_example_5_naming.png"
                class="card-img-top"
                alt="A mash up of the drive folder names and the document list generated in the previous image is shown side by side with weird little red arrows connecting the filename to the name and order they will have in the collection document."
              />
              <p>
                Now you can see how the naming played a role in the order of the
                documents. The condition I have set up for this is to always
                preceed a number with the pound(#) symbol. Any number after that
                will be intrepreted as an ordering element. Any text before the
                pound will be ignored, and subsiquently any text after the pound
                symbol will be the title of the chapter or section. If you need
                to include a pound symbol as the name of the document, do so
                after you have included the numbering element, ie: 'Chaper #1
                #gaylor'.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <img
                src="content/document_merger_example_options.png"
                class="card-img-top"
                alt=""
              />
              <p>
                Before clicking 'Merge', let me explain the two options that are
                provided.
              </p>
              <p>
                'Add Page Breaks Between Documents' when toggled on, blue with a
                check, will add a page break character between each of the
                documents in the merge. This will mean that each section that is
                created from a source document will start on a new page.
              </p>
              <p>
                'Perserve Original Formatting?' when toggled on, blue with a
                check, will do its best to maintain any formatting that has been
                applied to the text in the source document and transfer that
                into the container document, and only for that section. This
                works pretty well for font selection and colors and line
                spacing. It's not perfect I must admit.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <img
                src="content/document_merger_example_6_complete.png"
                class="card-img-top"
                alt=""
              />
              <p>
                After you have clicked Merge, you will see all of your text
                within the container document. To get the Outline to show on the
                left, navigate to View > Show Outline in the utility bar.
              </p>
            </li>
